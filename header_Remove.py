# Create a structured prompt for GPT
prompt = f"""
I have extracted multiple Markdown pages from a website, and I want to remove the header while keeping the main content intact.

Here are examples of Markdown pages:

---
### Page 1:
{markdown_pages[0]}

---
### Page 2:
{markdown_pages[1]}

---
### Page 3:
{markdown_pages[2]}

---

### Task:
1. Analyze the pattern in the headers across all these pages.
2. Identify where the **main content begins**, typically at the **first Markdown heading (`#`, `##`, `###`, etc.)**.
3. Generate a **generalized Python regex (`re` module)** that can remove such headers from any similar Markdown page.

### Requirements:
- The regex should work **dynamically** for different Markdown pages.
- It should **remove everything before the first Markdown heading** (e.g., `# Title`, `## Section`, `### Heading`).
- The regex must be formatted in **Python `re` syntax**, ready for use in `re.sub()`.
- **Do NOT hardcode any specific phrase**—it must work for different documents.

Please provide **only** the final regex along with a brief explanation of how it works.
