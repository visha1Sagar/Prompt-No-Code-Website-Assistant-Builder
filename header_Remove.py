I have extracted Markdown pages from a website, and I want to remove the header and footer while keeping the main content.

Here are multiple pages of the website’s markdown pages:

---
Page 1:
{markdown_pages[0]}

---
Page 2:
{markdown_pages[1]}

---
Page 3:
{markdown_pages[2]}

---

Please analyze the pattern in headers and footers across these pages and provide a **generalized regex** that can remove such headers and footers from any similar markdown page while keeping the main content intact.

The regex should be written in Python `re` format.
