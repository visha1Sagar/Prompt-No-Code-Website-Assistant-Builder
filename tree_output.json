It has been an exciting journey over the past four years. I would like to take a moment to reflect and express my gratitude to each member of NUST fraternity for their valuable support and partnership. Serving NUST has indeed been a unique experience and greatest honor of my life. It was a privilege to work with so many creative and talented minds. We have endured numerous challenges, alongside many achievements.\nOur collective efforts have advanced NUST as a leader in education, research, and innovation. I take immense pride in what our Pro Rectors, faculty, staff, students and alumni have accomplished. I have no doubt that NUST will continue to grow and excel as an institution of learning that will connect the past with the present and lead the future.\nAs I say farewell to you all, I am pleased to pass the baton to Dr Muhammad Zahid Latif.

Organized from 21st November to 5th December, the initiative showcased the university community\u2019s commitment to social welfare and generosity.\nClothing collection points were strategically placed at C1, C2 and C3, as well as in designated hostel rooms, ensuring easy access for donors. The drive witnessed overwhelming participation, with students and staff contributing generously.\nThe distribution event was held on Saturday, 7th December, at the F-7 Presbyterian Church of Pakistan. A team of 30 volunteers from the NUST Community Service Club (NCSC) and 10 volunteers from Wall of Hope ensured smooth operations during the event. Clothing items were carefully sorted by gender and age groups, allowing families to select items according to their specific requirements.\nThis thoughtful approach highlighted the organizers\u2019 commitment to supporting families in a respectful and efficient manner. The success of the drive reflected the university community\u2019s dedication to fostering compassion and addressing societal needs.\nThe Clothes Donation Drive 2024 not only provided much-needed warmth to families during the winter but also reinforced the importance of collective action in creating meaningful impact.\nCareer Development\nPlacements\nCentre for Counselling & Career Advisory\nProfessional Development\nQuality Assurance\nNUST Institute of Policy Studies\nStudent Affairs\nIndustry-Academia Linkages\n#### IMPORTANT LINKS\n#### In Focus\n  * > NUST at a Glance\n  * > Academic Calender\n  * > Academic Schedule\n  * > Student Helplines\n  * > Facilities at NUST\n  * > Contact Us\n  * > Trademark Notice\n  * > Offices and Resources\n  * > Marketing and Guidelines\n\n\n#### Quick Links\n  * > Innovation & Commercialisation\n  * > Library\n  * > Downloads\n  * > Defaulter's list\n  * > Grievances Review Committee\n  * > Tender Information\n  * > Feedback\n  * > NUST Anti-Harassment Helpline\n  * > Online Degree/Transcript Verification\n  * > Career Development Centre\n\n\n#### NUST UAN\n  * +92-51-111-11-6878\n\n\n#### Address\nNational University of Sciences & Technology (NUST) Campus, Sector H-12, Islamabad, Pakistan\n#### Location Map\n#### \n  * Home\n  * Contact Us\n\n\n\u00a9 2025 National University of Sciences and Technology.

The ultimate aim of these endeavours is to ensure our brand has an instant and lasting recall amongst all stakeholders and target audience, including students, prospective students, alumni, industry, donors, Government, international partners, and so on.\nThe NUST Brand Book is an attempt to streamline collective efforts of the NUST community to visually reinforce our identity, and is designed to serve as a manual for the promotion of NUST\u2019s brand image through conventional and unorthodox vehicles. The book comprises guidelines for usage of NUST logo, colour palette, typeface recommendations, and much more.\nWe invite you to acclimatise yourselves with these guidelines, and join us in promoting a unified NUST identity!\n### NUST OFFICIAL SEAL\n### \nThe official seal was created in 2008.
